# Early Detection of Osteoporosis using Machine Learning
 This project focuses on predicting osteoporosis early using machine learning techniques applied to clinical and lifestyle data. Osteoporosis is a silent disease that often goes undetected until fractures occur. Our model helps identify individuals at high risk early, enabling preventive care and better health outcomes.
 Predict osteoporosis risk based on health and lifestyle features

Identify major risk contributors using ML-based feature analysis

Compare performance of multiple ML models

Work toward a deployable screening solution for healthcare use
